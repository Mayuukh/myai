        <h1><b><u>The uses of Artificial Intelligence.</u></b></h1>
        <h2><b><i>About:</i></b></h2>
        <p><i>Artificial Intelligence is where machines simulate aspects of human or animal intelligence. This is done using programmed algorithms. It can be used for problem solving,planning,learning through experience,processing language,perception and even social intelligence.</i></p>
        <h2> Home:</h2>
        <p><i>Smartphone-based "assistants allow parts of our home to be controlled automatically. They can set alarms,provide reminders about upcoming events and control heating,lightning and security.They can even learn from us,for example suggesting music based on our past choices.</i></p>
        <h2>HealthCare:</h2>
        <p><i>AI can help give the correct medicines to patients.Robots with AI are also being developed to perform and assist with basic surgery.</i></p>
        <h2>Education:</h2>
        <p><i>AI is already being used to mark and grade test papers.AI "tutors" could also be used to help students with homework,answer basic questions and help pupils with disabilities.</i></p>
        <h2>Automotive:</h2>
        <p><i>Self-driving cars are no longer the stuff of science fiction! They use sensors to detect obstacles,navigate roads and read road signs.However, their use raises ethical concerns,such as what happens if there is an accident.</i></p>
        <h2>Entertainment:</h2>
        <p><i>In video games,AI is used to simulate the behaviour of human players.This gives a more realistic experience when playing against the computer. </i></p>
